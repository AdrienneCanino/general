# hello-world
My first repo, to be filled with all the exciting new things.

I'm a science and data librarian, currently at University of Rochester in upstate New York.
I am interested in coding education, Open Science, and so open-source software, as well as information privilege and informal science education.
I have a dog who hides during thunderstorms and enjoy hiking, gardening and tinkering.
